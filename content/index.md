This is my personal collection of posts around software engineering and my career in the
tech industry. I hope you somehow enjoy the content.

The articles here were published on medium previously and then migrated due to my personal
issues with the platform's paywall that although was not enabled on my posts is disgusting and
makes me skip any google result for medium.
